                <p>Hi,</p>
                <p>Thank you very much for visiting Blendedd and clicking on the stories link. Hopefully we will have more stories in the future.</p>
                <p>At this time, it's just a story from me (Edward).</p>
                <p>I enjoy renting out items to help other people, help save our planet's resources and earn a little extra income. Items that I have rented out in the past have been bikes, cotton candy machine, popcorn machine, hot dog warmer, and costumes. I never got around to renting power tools, miter saw, air compressor with nail gun, and rug doctor carpet shampooer (from Costco). I was afraid to rent my Honda portable generator because I did not want to ask for a high security deposit amount and/or not able to ask for a credit card number. All of these situations really gave me the insight to start Blendedd.</p>
                <p>Thank You.<br/>
                    Edward</p>
                <p>Save money, Earn money, Help save the planet. One rental at a time.</p>
