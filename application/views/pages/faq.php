                <h3>What is Blendedd ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Blendedd is a peer-to-peer rental and service company.</p>

                <h3>Why should I use Blendedd ?</h3>

                <br />
                <h3>Why the name Blendedd ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>In this world, we are all part of the human race and are blendedd, but just most of us don't know it</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Why the extra "d" at the end of Blendedd ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Unfortunately Blended was already taken and almost all good/great names are taken also.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>How does Blendedd work ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>On our home page, there is a link to a diagram that explains how Blendedd works. Blendedd is a platform/marketplace where people can list and rent items, provide and buy services. Both parties work out the details/logistic, such as if a security deposit and/or lease are needed. Blendedd provides a secure payment platform and helpful feedback feature.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Who founded Blendedd ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Blendedd was founded by Edward Mei and Sameer Jain.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Where did the idea for Blendedd come from ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>One of the founders, Edward ,has been renting personal items for years. After seeing the rise of the sharing economy and companies, like Uber, Airbnb, Groupon, Task Rabbit, Angieslist, etc..<br/>
                    Edward and Sameer decided that the consumer just needs to go to one website and have their needs met. At this time, categories such as childcare, housing and rides are not available.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>How do I sign up for Blendedd?</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>Please go to <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>signup"><?php echo base_url(); ?>signup</a><br/>
                    You have the option to select either individual or business<br/>
                    All the red asterisk (*) field are mandatory. The fields are required by our payment provider, Braintreepayments.<br/>

                <br/>
                <h3>Why am I not able to do a posting after I signed up?</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>If you get an error about your address, your address needs to be filled in completely with the number and street address.<br/>
                    Please check carefully your routing number and account number.<br/>
                    Sometimes account number needs zeros in front of the account number.<br/>
                    Using my Chase checking account number at the branch, I never had to write zero on a deposit/withdraw slip, but when I was setting the account on Blendedd, it was then I discover the account needed zeros.<br/>
                    Please check your banking statement (paper or online) and/or give your bank a call and mention you are entering your entire bank account information for online payments.<br/>
                    You can also check online about routing information for a particular banking company.<br/>

                    Sometimes the bank account verification process might take a little while to verified because it depends on our payment provider (Braintreepayments)<br/>
                    Sometimes you might need to log out and log back in for the changes to take <br/>
                    effect. Sorry for any inconveniences.</p>

                <br/>
                <h3>When I sign up to do rentals and/or services, when do I get paid ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Payment is deposit into your bank account within 12 business day after the transaction has been paid. When you register, fill out your bank account information or update your account tab to receive payments.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Why do you need my bank account information ? (Addressing concerns)</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>When a transaction is done, Blendedd needs to deposit 90 percent of that transaction into your bank account. It's just that simple.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>Can I just use Paypal ? (Addressing concerns)</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>No Paypal does not do the payment requirements that Blendedd needs to do. Braintreepayments is also a subsidiary of PayPal.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>What if the person does not return my rental item? (Addressing concerns)</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>I (Edward) truly believe that people are 85 percent good/descent overall.<br/>
                    There are easy ways to scam/defraud people than using Blendedd.<br/>
                    To pay for a rental, you have to sign up on Blendedd's registration page, which requiresyour real name, address and a valid credit card. Braintreepayments helps Blendedd check the identity/credentials of people signing up.  People doing scams do not want to be identified. Blendedd knows this process might be a barrier to sign up but we rather have honest community/users than let people be anonymous. To make sure you are not dealing the other 15 percent, please do your due diligence, ask questions and the most important thing is to follow your feelings/gut.</p>
                <br/>
                <h3>What about sales tax ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>If sales tax needs to be charged and/or collected, the business providing the rental and/or service will charge and/or collect the sales tax.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Any refund request must be submitted to <a href="mailto:support@blendedd.com">support@blendedd.com</a> within 2 business days after the transaction has been paid.</p>
                <h3>Is my information safe?</h3>
