                <h3>What is Feedback and how does it affect my reputation?</h3>
                <br />
                Each time you rent or buy something, you have an opportunity to leave Feedback about your experience.<br/>
                Feedback consists of a positive, negative or neutral rating, along with a comment.<br/>
                Owner, renter, people providing services, and people buying services build reputations that are based on all the Feedback ratings and comments left by their transaction partners<br/>
                <br/>
                The information is available in each person's Feedback profile. People can view your Feedback profile by clicking the number in parentheses next to your user ID. When reviewing your Feedback, people can see the number of positive, neutral, and negative Feedback ratings you've received and read comments from other people.<br/>
                <br/>
                Positive Feedback tells people you are a responsible person. Because online transactions depend on trust, your Feedback is an important way to build your reputation on Blendedd.<br/>
                Whenever you do a transaction, you can leave Feedback about the transaction.<br/>
                The other party in your transaction can leave Feedback for you as well.<br/>
                Note: Owner of rental items and people/business provide services can leave negative, neutral, or positive Feedback. Renter of rental items and people/business buying services can leave negative, neutral, or positive Feedback.<br/>
                <br/>
                Over time, Blendedd registered users develop a Feedback profile, or reputation, based on other people's comments and ratings. The Feedback score is one of the most important pieces of a Feedback profile. The Feedback score is the number in parentheses next to someone's user ID.<br/>
                <br />
                <h3>Feedback scores and symbols</h3>
                <br />
                For each transaction, Renter of rental items and people/business buying services and owner of rental items, people/business provides services can leave a positive, negative, or a neutral rating, plus a short comment.<br/>
                <br/>
                We use these ratings to determine Feedback scores. In most cases, register users receive:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>+1 point for each positive rating</li>
                    <li>No points for each neutral rating</li>
                    <li>-1 point for each negative rating</li>
                </ul>
